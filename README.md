To convert speech to text using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can make use of the Web Speech API. This API allows you to detect speech in an audio input and convert it to text. You can use the API to create a speech recognition object that listens to the user's speech and converts it to text. HTML and CSS can be used to create a user interface for the speech recognition object. JavaScript is used to handle the speech recognition process. The Web Speech API has good compatibility with modern web browsers.
